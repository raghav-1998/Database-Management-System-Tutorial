1. Consider an application for an educational institute. Every department has several instructors but an instructor 
can be associated with only one department. One among the instructors would act as head of the department. 
Instructors are allocated to take classes in multiple courses. There are many instructors for a given course. 
Make relations based on information & identify Primary Keys & Foreign keys. 

2. Consider a banking application where customers have accounts. Every customer has a unique customer id. A 
customer can have multiple accounts in the bank. Multiple customers can share the same account number 
(joint account). Accounts can be of various types like saving account, current account; recurring account etc. 
Minimum balance must be maintained in each of these account types. Customers can perform deposit and 
withdrawal transactions through various means like online, cheque, cash etc. A transaction can be initiated by a 
single customer. A customer must have a name, address and email id. Contact number is optional.
Make relations based on information & identify Primary Keys & Foreign keys.
